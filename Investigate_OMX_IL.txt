1. How to prepare buffer?
- The component must be in the idle  state by using SendCommand(handle, OMX CommandStateSet, OMX StateIdle) 

2. Meaning of OMX and condition for the event occur.
Condition for the event occur: successful execution of a command, detection of a marked buffer by a component, component changes its
port settings, an end of stream is encountered, a component gets resources that it has been waiting for.

3. How to config a port?
- OMX_GetParameter is called to retrieve the number of ports supported by OMX component 
( OMX_GetParameter(handle, OMX_IndexParamPortDefinition, &portdef) )
- The component returns the number of ports supported as well as the base port index to
retrieve the individual port configuration.
- For each port, the client can get information about the preferred buffer size, number of
buffers, etc., of the component. (OMX_GetParameter(handle, OMX_IndexParamPortDefinition, &portDefn)
- The IL client can call OMX_SetParameter to configure the port with either the configuration
retrieved or with a different configuration.

Configuration parameters of port: 
nBufferCOuntMin: The minimum number of buffers this port requires
nBufferSize: Minimum buffer size in bytes allocated for this port
eDir: Direction of port
bEnabled: Ports have a state flag as to whether they are enabled or disabled
eDomain

(Then for each type of struct there is a corresponding index value. For the OMX_PARAM_PORTDEFINITIONTYPE, the index is OMX_IndexParamPortDefinition)


4. Is it true "The number of OMX_EmptyThisBuffer should equal with the number of OMX_FillThisBuffer"?
No, it's wrong.

5. When should we use Mark Buffer?

6. What case in which buffer payload will be use?
Case 1: Each buffer is filled in whole or in part.
Case 2: Each buffer is filled with only complete frames of compressed data.

7. Can we send OMX_EmptyThisBuffer when FillBufferDone has not callback yet?
Yes, we can. 

8. What is component sources, sinks?
Component with a single output port are referred to as source components.
Component with a single input port are referred to as sink components.

9. What happen when not allocating enough buffer that was defined in the port definition?
The component will raise an error event to IL-Client.

10. What is resource concealment methods?
Resource concealment method is a technique used in signal processing that aims
to minimize the deterioration of signals caused by missing data

11. What is different between OMX_AllocateBuffer and OMX_UseBuffer?

12. Can we count the number of output image by counting number of OMX_FillThisBuffer? If not, please describe how to count number of output image!

13. What should IL-Client do when receiving an Event error?
The IL Client shall stop, de-initialize, unload, and reload the component when the IL Client detects an event error.
